# Plan

Home page - grid with one photo of each keeb

About page - the description of the 'forum', forum rules

Detail page - for each keeb we can describe the details of it, add additional photos, have user comments below, etc.

Create post page - just empty fields and buttons. No need to implement the actual signup functionality.


reminders:
we need to have a footer with both of our names on it
